# TF2 Roguelike
Uses the base MvM gamemode combined with custom items & game mechanics. (potential PvP support as well?)

# Mechanics
All players upon selecting a class will have the choice to apply a 
powerup combined with class specific bonuses and compensations such as Sniper dealing criticals on tanks.

When entering a MvM upgrade station, you are given the option of a selection of items for a cost that is added every wave completion.
Each item has unique effects that can stack additively or multiplicatively, distinguished by a + or x sign (ex: 1.1x, +10%).
